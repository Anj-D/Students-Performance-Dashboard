# Students-Performance-Dashboard
Performance analysis dashboard of students across States in the US using Power Bi and features therein.
# Overview
This project analyzes student test scores using Power BI to identify factors influencing academic performance. The dataset consists of two tables: Students (name,extracurricular activities, student number) and Test Scores (school year, district, state, grade, math & reading scores, math & reading tutoring hours).

# Key Insights
* ðŸ“Š Best Performing School Districts & States â€“ Identified top-performing regions based on test scores.
* ðŸ“ˆ Impact of Tutoring on Scores â€“ Analyzed the optimal tutoring hours required as well as the period of tutoring (morning/noon sessions) for improved results.
* ðŸŽ­ Extracurricular Influence â€“ Evaluated how participation in activities affects academic performance.
* ðŸ“‰ Grade-Level Trends â€“ Assessed performance variations across different grades.
* Here are some snaps of the analysis-

# Recommendation
* **Increase math tutoring hours** for grades **9** and **12**, as grades 10 and 11 are currently receiving a disproportionate share of tutoring time.
* **Wyoming** is the top-performing state; its model should be analyzed and replicated in other states
* **Sports** is the most effective extracurricular activity, contributing to consistent performance in both math and reading. In contrast, **debate participants** excel in math but underperform in reading, skewing overall results.
* **Optimal tutor periods** for math are 1st, 2nd, and 4th, while 3rd and 6th periods yield the best results for reading.

# Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Power BI**: Data visualization & dashboard creation
* **DAX:** Custom measures & calculated columns for insights
* **Power Query:** Data transformation & cleaning
* **Data Modeling:** Relationship building for analysis
